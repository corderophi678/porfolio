## Short Thoughts on 'Justice'

In *An Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals*, David Hume says some really interesting things about the concept of Justice. Justice, of course, is a notoriously difficult concept. Offer a definition of Justice, and someone will offer a counter-example. Kongzi‚Äôs (Confucius) *Analects* deals heavily with issues of justice. Plato‚Äôs *Republic* is, largely, a book *on* justice. Both Kongzi and Plato were knocking about several hundred years BCE. Hume was writing about it in the 18th Century. And more recently, John Rawls wrote what many philosophers (in the Western tradition üôÑ)  regard as some of the most influential pieces of politcal philosophy of the 20th Century ‚Äì in particular his book *A Theory of Justice*. The point is that a lot has been said, a lot will be said. Nothing that‚Äôs been said has seemed to very many people to be definitive. But there‚Äôs still a lot we can learn. I‚Äôd like to take a second to look at a couple of things Hume said and maybe try to draw some conclusions relevant for today‚Äôs American Predicament.

So, Hume thought that Justice was a virtue. He says that the virtues are those traits that produce feelings of approval, in ourselves or in others, regardless of whether the trait is our own or someone else‚Äôs. But Justice is a little peculiar because Justice is the sort of thing that depends a lot on its circumstances. That is, Justice might not always be a virtue.

>‚ÄúSuppose‚Ä¶that it should be a virtuous [person]'s fate to fall into [a] society of ruffians, remote from the protection of laws and government; what conduct must [they] embrace in that melancholy situation? [The person] sees such a desperate rapaciousness prevail; such a disregard to equity, such contempt of order, such [foolish disregrd of] future consequences, as must immediately have the most tragical conclusion, and must terminate in destruction to the greater number, and in a total dissolution of society to the rest...And [the person‚Äôs] particular regard to justice being no longer of USE to [their] own safety or that of others, [they] must consult the dictates of self-preservation alone, without concern for those who no longer merit [their] care or attention.‚Äù

That last line is *key*.

When the law is no longer on our side, when it treats us unequally, when we are victims of our own society ‚Äì why should we act justly? How can we act justly? What would it even look like?

It seems to me that Hume, one of the most venerated (and racist), philosophers ever is telling us that when society is no longer civil, when we no longer have a place, we owe nothing to those who deprive us of our membership in society.

In such a society, individuals ought to protect themselves. That‚Äôll mean different things to different people. But one thing that it means for everyone is that, unless or until there‚Äôs change, there is no such thing as Justice. And any actions we, who are systematically discriminated against undertake in our own defense, are, by the very nature of the situation not acting in any sort of violation of Justice.
