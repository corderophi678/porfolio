Suppose you work for a company and one day you learn that the company has taken a contract to provide services to an organization that you think is morally reprehensible. What is your reaction? You're upset, surely. You raise the matter with your bosses, probably. Do they know that the company they're working with is as morally reprehensible as you believe it to be? Turns out they do. They do and they're taking money to provide services anyway. So, what do you do?

In 2019, what people seem to tend to do is get a group of coworkers together and write a letter that they then post on the internet to try to put pressure on their bosses to bring about change. This is cool. This might be effective. I guess it sort of has been before.

Now, this is just my perspective. And I definitely don't know what I'm talking about, in particular because I don't know the particular details of your life, right? But, all things being equal, what I tend to think is this: You know what might be more effective AND keep the moral stain off of your soul? Quit your job. Quit working for the organization that decided it was OK to take that contract. Even if they change, why on earth would you want to work for someone or a group of people that thought that sort of thing would be OK? If no one had complained, would they have changed anything? Probably not, right? So, yeah, you did something awesome, you got your company to change what they were going to do. But you're still working for a company that thought it was OK in the first place. Why would you be cool with that? How can you be cool with that?

I get it, you've got bills, right? You've got rent or a mortgage. You want that new iPhone. You have a family. You'll probably *never* get another job, especially given the fact you worked for such a high profile company. Right.

Again, I don't know the particulars of your life. But all things being equal, this is what I kinda think.
