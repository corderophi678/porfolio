## Huh...You can't even tell...

A little more than a week ago, my partner and I drove from Buffalo, NY to Tallahassee, FL, then from Tallahassee, FL to Gainesville, FL to attend my partner's grandmother's funeral. After the funeral service, there was a gathering for the family to have a bite to eat and enjoy each other's company for a bit. These sorts of family things are always really nerve-wracking for me. I hadn't met a lot of the people who were there, some family, some friends, most of them strangers to me. You can't ever tell at these things how much people know about you. Had the people who'd already met me told any of those who hadn't that I have a disability? Do they know I have only one leg? Turns out, at least one person didn't.

So, I'm sitting there at a table with my partner, some of her cousins, and a friend of the family -- we'll call him George. George is an elderly man who likes to chat. No, you know what, let's call him Charles. Chatty Charles. So, there's a lull in the conversation and we're all just sitting there. And a propos of nothing, Charles turns to me and asks, "So, uh...what happened to your leg?" I stifle a sigh. I control myself. I don't flip the table. I don't simply get up and leave. I take a breath. "Oh? Uh, nothing? I...just don't have one. Was born without it." Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty even-tempered. I was super proud of myself.

I don't know what goes on in people's heads to make them think it's OK to ask personal medical questions of other folks. I'd decided a long time ago that my response to such questions should be something more like, "Nothing. Say, have you ever had an STI? Ever have gonorrhea or anything like that? You know...since we're asking each other inappropriate questions about our medical history. I'm just curious." I've yet to manage the courage to follow through on this, though.

Anyhow, after I told Charles "what happened to my leg" (again, nothing, never had it, can't have something happen to a thing that never was), he follows it up with, "Huh! You can't even tell..." [that I use a prosthesis].

You can't even tell. I know Charles said this with a sort of kindness in his heart. I know he meant no malice. I know that. But what was Charles *actually* saying? The remark is implicitly, if not explicitly, a compliment. And it's a compliment because Charles thinks it's better not to be able to tell than to be able to tell. Because it's better to have two legs than to have fewer than two. But if you have to have fewer than two, it's better that no one knows by looking at you that you have fewer than two legs than it is if they can tell by looking at you. So what does that *actually* say about someone who *actually* has only one leg? Whatever it says, it's nothing good.

This sort of thing is infuriating. I would advise you not to do this sort of thing. When meeting people with disabilities, don't offer *any* sort of evaluative remarks about their condition or the way they live. Just don't.
