title: Goodbye, head!

I've been trying to bring about some changes to my daily life lately. It's slow going, as things sometimes are. Late last week I deactivated my Twitter account. I thought I'd give it the weekend and see how I felt. Turns out, within minutes of reactivating my account on Monday (I think I clocked it at around 11 minutes), I was feeling the overwhelming weight of the world's horribleness. I guess in a way it's my own fault, right? My feed is the feed that I've chosen to have. So, it's time to continue pursuing change. Might tweet, might retweet and favorite things occasionally, but by and large I won't be around. In a way, I suppose it's been a long time coming. I've been a bit more of a lurker these past few months. So, this seems like the natural progression of things.

I'll probably set this thing up to be where I say the inane things I desperately need to get out into the world (Like <a href="/posts/goodbye-head">this</a>).
